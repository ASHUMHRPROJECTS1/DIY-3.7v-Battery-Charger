# DIY-3.7v-Battery-Charger


Batteries are an important part of any battery-operated project or
product. Rechargeable batteries are expensive because they require a
separate charger, but they\'re worth the investment because they last
longer and cost less over time than regular disposable batteries. They
come in several di erent varieties based on their electrode materials
and electrolytes---lead-acid, nickel cadmium (NiCd), nickel metal
hydride (NiMH), lithium ion (Li-ion), and lithium ion polymer (Li-ion
polymer).
